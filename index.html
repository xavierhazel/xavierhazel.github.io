    <h2>what is inside the mystery black box</h2>
    <p> We beleive that inside the mystery black box, there is a water pressure activated plate that has somewhat random increased and decreased outputs.</p>
    <p>The mystery black box released more, slightly less or much less than what was put into it. Our tests were based on the input of water into the top and the output of water at the bottom. We determined that the box was mainly hollow and would release water if tilted forward, even if it was not outputting water before that point.
We tested our model, a water pressure activation plate, by pouring water from the top into our main component system, a capture and release pressure plate, and measuring the amount of output water in comparison to what we loaded in. All of our trials resulted in a loss of water but we occasionally gained momentary increases of water. We ran a total of 10 trials with an input amount of 100ml per trial, and our water pressure plate mechanism output results range from 20-90mL.</p>
